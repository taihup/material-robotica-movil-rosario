\section{Rapidly-exploring Random Tree}
In this part, you are provided with a robot arm that has 2 links is able to move in a 2D plane only. Your task is to implement Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), a classical sampling-based motion planning algorithms named after its data structure, and study the parameters that govern its behaviors.

\subsection{Code Overview}
The starter code for RRT is under the \texttt{rrt} folder. Here is a brief overview.

\subsection{RRT Implementation}
Implement a RRT planner for the 2D robot in \texttt{RRTPlanner.py} by filling in \texttt{Plan} and \texttt{extend} functions. Your results from a successful RRT implementation should be comparable to the following results:

\begin{verbatim}
$ python plan.py -o 0 --seed 0
...
cost: 198.84383834015168

$ python plan.py -o 2 --seed 0
...
cost: 170.48992200228264
\end{verbatim}

If you turn on the \texttt{-v} flag, i.e. \texttt{python plan.py --seed 0 -v}, you should see a plot similar to Fig. \ref{fig:rrt}.

 \begin{figure}[h]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{example-image-a}
     \caption{Example RRT path in configuration space.}
     \label{fig:rrt}
 \end{figure}

\textbf{Answer the following questions.}

Note that since RRT is non-deterministic, you will need to provide statistical results, i.e. mean and standard deviation over \textbf{at least 5 runs} with different random seeds specified by \texttt{--seed}.

The \texttt{-o} flag specifies the number of obstacles in the environment. Please report your results with \texttt{-o 2}. You can use other values for debugging.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bias the sampling to pick the goal with $5\%$, $20\%$ probability. Report the performance (cost and time). For each setting, include at least one figure like Fig. \ref{fig:rrt} showing the RRT tree in configuration space. Which value would you pick in practice?
    \item You can view the robot as a point that can move in arbitrarily directions in the configuration space. In other words, the states can be interpolated via a straight line (see Fig. \ref{fig:extend} for an illustration). Compare two strategies for the \texttt{extend()} function:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the nearest neighbor extends only half way to the sampled point (i.e. step size $\eta=0.5$)
        \item the nearest neighbor extends all the way till the sampled point (i.e. step size $\eta=1$)
    \end{itemize}
    Report the performance (cost, time) for each setting. Include at least one figure showing the final state of the RRT tree. Which strategy would you employ in practice?
    \item Discuss any challenges you faced and describe your debugging process.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image-a}
    \caption{Visualization of \texttt{extend()} with step size $\eta$, which controls the ratio of the distance from $x_{\text{new}}$ (the state to be added) to $x_{\text{near}}$ and the distance from $x_{\text{rand}}$ (the sampled state) to $x_{\text{near}}$. If $\eta=1$, $x_{\text{new}}=x_{\text{rand}}$.}
    \label{fig:extend}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Hint:}
Check out these useful functions that you should use to simplify your implementation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \texttt{RRTTree.py}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{AddVertex}
        \item \texttt{AddEdge}
        \item \texttt{GetNearestVertex}
    \end{itemize}
    \item In \texttt{ArmEnvironment.py}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{compute\_distance}
        \item \texttt{goal\_criterion}
        \item \texttt{edge\_validity\_checker}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
